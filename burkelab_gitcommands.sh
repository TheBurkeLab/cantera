# # 1.	Delete the local branch:

# git branch -d $branchName # (if the branch has unmerged changes, you may need to force delet it using ‘-D’ instead of ‘-d’)
# # 2.	Delete the remote branch: 
# git push origin --delete $branchName

# # To merge the latest version of the remote github branch and your local branch:
# # 1.	Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository: 
# git fetch origin
# # 2.	Checkout your local branch: 
# git checkout <yourLocalBranch>
# # 3.	Merge the remote branch into your local branch: 
# git merge origin/remote_branch_name

# # To overwrite your local branch with a remote branch:
# # 1.	Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository: 
# git fetch origin
# # 2.	Reset your local branch to the remote branch: 
# git reset –hard origin/remote_branch_name
# # 3.	Force push the changes to the remote repository: 
# git push origin your_local_branch –force

# # Copy a subdirectory from a previous commit on a different branch to the current version:
# # 1.	Check out the target branch: 
# git checkout burkelab
# # 2.	Create a temporary directory to copy the subdirectory from the commit: 
# mkdir temp_directory
# # 3.	Check out the subdirectory from the specific commit to the temporary directory: 
# git checkout b41d530c125e9bb1318d70d6f6fe7e0e38042ddb -- C:\\Users\\pjsin\\Documents\\cantera\\burkelab_SimScripts
# # 4.	Move the subdirectory to the desired location in your current branch: 
# mv temp_directory/burkelab_SimScripts path/to/desired/location
# # 5.	Add the subdirectory to the staging area: 
# git add path/to/desired/location/burkelab_SimScripts
# # 6.	Commit the changes: 
# git commit -m "Add burkelab_SimScripts from commit b41d530c125e9bb1318d70d6f6fe7e0e38042ddb on branch burkelab_PCI2024_oldCode"
